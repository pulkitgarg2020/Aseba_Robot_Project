# Aseba_Robot_Project
This project is to make the Aseba robot follow a 1.5 to 2 cm thick black taped path with obstacles on the way. The obstales on the track are green plastic Duplo hurdles which are 10cm wide, 3cm deep and 6 cm high. As soon as the robot detects and object, it is programmed to go around the object from the right and then follow the line back again. 
This project uses the Thymio robot and the Aseba programming environment.
