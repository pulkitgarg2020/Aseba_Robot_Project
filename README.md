# Aseba_Robot_Project

This project is to make the Aseba robot follow a 1.5 to 2 cm thick black taped path with obstacles on the way. The obstales on the track are green plastic Duplo hurdles which are 10cm wide, 3cm deep and 6 cm high. As soon as the robot detects and object, it is programmed to go around the object from the right and then follow the line back again. 

A simulator is provided in the repo which can be used to test the program. However, the program has been tested on the physical Thymio robot. A video has been provided in the repo to depict a sample run of the program on a real robot. 

The project is based on the principles of a state machine and uses Aseba programming language. Writing this program required programming the motors, five frontal proximity sensors and two ground proximity sensorus. Also the LEDs at the top of the robot has been programmed to show which state the robot is in.  

## How to setup?
